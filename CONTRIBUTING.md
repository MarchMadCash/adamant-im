## How to contribute

We try to create a stable project, fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

Before you start, read the **[README.md](/README.md)** file for info on the project and how to set it up.

## Reporting issues

 1. Check if problem already exist in [issues tab](https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant-im/issues)
 2. If not, create a new [issue](https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant-im/issues/new)
 3. Define your issue. Try to provide more information, so that it will be easy to replicate it.
 4. Click `Submit new issue`

##### Guidance

 * Include screenshots or animated GIF
 * Use a clear and descriptive title
 * Provide OS and browser version

## Writing some code!

It is easy to start contributing to a project on Github. You should:

- Fork this repo.

Read the code available and apply your changes according to the changes you're working on! Yours change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

Start from the `dev` branch.
All changes must be merged into dev branch before going to `master`.

## Creating commits
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

##### Before creating PR make sure that:
 - All conflicts are resolved

When you're done, submit a pull request and wait for any of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.
## Pull Requests
 - Title
   - Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" not "Fixed bug")
   - Use this structure `[What the PR is about] - Closes #[issue number]`
   ex. `Fix bug - Closes #123`
- Description
    - Provide clear and understandable description fo your changes
- Base branch
  - Make sure that base branch of PR is the `dev` branch
